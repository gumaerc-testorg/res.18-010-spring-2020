## Description

In this video, Professor Strang provides an overall look at linear algebra by highlighting five different ways that a matrix gets factored.

For every matrix *A*, four key vector spaces are the row space and nullspace of *A* and its transpose.         
To compute with *A*, we factor it into  *A* = (column space basis) times (row space basis).        
The simplest basis uses independent columns taken directly from the matrix *A*.        
The best bases of all use \*orthogonal\*  vectors from the column space and the row space of *A*.        
These "singular vectors" produce the great Singular Value Decomposition!
