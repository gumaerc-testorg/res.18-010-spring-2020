**Description**

If a matrix *A* has rank *r*, then its row echelon form (after elimination) contains the identity matrix in its first *r* independent columns. How do we interpret the matrix *F* that appears in the remaining *n* − *r* columns of that echelon form? *F* multiplies those first *r* independent columns of *A* to give its *n* − *r* dependent columns. Then *F* reveals bases for the row space and the nullspace of the original matrix *A*. And *F* is the key to the column-row factorization *A = CR.*
