**Description**

The four subspaces are the column spaces and the nullspaces of *A* and *A*^T: two perpendicular subspaces in *m-*dimensional space and two more in *n*\-dimensional space. *A* is invertible when *m* \= *n* and both nullspaces contain only the zero vector.

When *A* is NOT invertible, we look for the vector *x* in the row space that makes || *Ax* - *b* || AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE in the column space. 

This video finds that winning vector! Instead of *x* = *A*^-1 *b* (that inverse doesn't exist) we introduce the  "pseudoinverse" of *A*.
